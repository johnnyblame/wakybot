I would gladly bear any curse to save my homeland.
Father.. forgive me for what I have to do..
This kingdom shall fall, and from the ashes shall arise a new order that will shake the very foundations of the world. 
We may never know, Uther. I intend to live forever.
Get over it already.
Shut up you damned ghost.
So, you're not upset about me killing you that one time?
Greetings, dreadlords. I should thank you for looking after my kingdom during my absence. However, I won't be requiring your services any longer.
It's time to end the game. Once, and for all.
Nothing shall prevent me from having my revenge, old friend. Not even you!
Yes, I've damned everyone and everything I've ever loved in his name, and I still feel no remorse. No shame. No pity.
After all you've put me through, woman, the last thing I'll give you is the peace of death.
No we. No one tells me what to do. I've got everything I need from youâ€”now the power is mine and mine alone. Now there is only I. I am the Lich King. And I am ready.
