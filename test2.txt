You are not prepared.
Betrayer... In truth, it was I who was betrayed. Still, I am hunted. Still, I am hated. Now, my blind eyes see what others cannot: that sometimes the hand of fate must be forced! Now go forth... unleash the tides of Doom... Upon all those...who would oppose us.
I'm blind, not deaf.
Well? Come with me... if you'd like to live long enough to see me save this world!
Isolation can do that to the mind. Now, after all the long centuries you kept me chained in darkness, it is only fitting that I bury you in turn.
"We have had much strife between us, my brother. I have known only ages of hate for you. But, for my part, I wish it to end. From this day forward, let there be peace between us.
Perhaps hiding here was not the most prudent decision.
Now, follow me mortals. Into the abyss..
So many demons, not enough time.
Death to the legion!
Sometimes the hand of Fate... must be forced!
My destiny is my own.
I am my scars!
There can be no chosen one... only we... can save ourselves!
